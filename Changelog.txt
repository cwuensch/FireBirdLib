            Added LAN_Bulgarian
2007-09-02  Changed the return code of HDD_TAP_Start. As it can't detect if a TAP has been successfully launched,
              HDD_TAP_Start returns 0 if something goes wrong before starting the TAP. Otherwise a 1 is returned
2007-09-03  Added "à" to the list of invalid file name characters. It prevents a file name from being listed in the Toppies native filer
2007-09-04  Bugfix: FileSelector didn't distinguish between directories and files if both had the same name
            Bugfix: Sometimes INI_Get* returned a wrong value instead of the default value

2007-09-08  Added DialogWindowAlpha
2007-09-11  Added the WinFileAttribute field to tFileSlot and the WINFILEATTRIBUTE defines
2007-09-17  Added HDD_TAP_PushDir, HDD_TAP_PopDir, INILocateFile
            Modified the behaviour of the INI, language and profile blocks. On load operations, the TAP will
              automatically
            check the following directories and load the first hit:
              * current dir
              * /ProgramFiles/Settings/<AppName>  (if AppName has been provided)
              * /ProgramFiles/Settings
              * /ProgramFiles

            Due to that change, the parameters of the following functions have changed:
              * INIOpenFile, INISaveFile
              * DialogProfileLoad, DialogProfileLoadMy, DialogProfileSave, DialogProfileCheck
              * LangLoadStrings

2007-11-04  'Official release'

2007-11-05  Changed 'unknown3' to 'SlotCRC' in tFileSlot
2007-11-07  When transcoding a REC header with HDD_EncodeRECHeader, the transponder block is filled
              with useful data instead of 0x00
2007-11-11  Bugfix: if a integer value in a INI file was larger than the allowed maximum or smaller
              than the allowed minimum, INIGetInt returned the default value instead of the minimum
              or maximum value. The same was true for INIGetHexByte, -Word, -DWord.
2007-11-14  Merged the FLASH_TYPE and HEADER_TYPE enums into one single SYSTEM_TYPE
            Improved HDD_DecodeRECHeader to auto detect TF5700 REC headers

            The following updates have been provided by R2-D2
            TAP_Hdd_Fwrite:  added to TAPAPIFix (doesn't write junk to fill the 512 byte buffer)
            TAP_Hdd_Flen TAPAPIFix: added the detection of a fixed/patched firmware Flen
            Added the TimeFormat flag to EEPROMSTRUCT
            Added tPlaySlot

2008-01-08  Modified HDD_GetHDDInfo so that it also works correctly on TF6xxxs
            Fixed DialogProfileSaveDefault: it will now save to a moved DialogProfile.ini instead of
              creating a new one in /ProgramFiles
2008-01-10  PatchApply checks if a patch is still applicable
2008-01-11  Added LoadFirmwareDat

            'Official release'

2008-02-19  Fixed a bug in InitTAPex, which caused HDD_TAP_Start to crash
            HDD_GetFirmwareDirCluster will return -1 instead of 0 in case of a fault
2008-02-22  HDD_FindPCR returns -1 instead of 0 in case of an unavailable PCR packet
            Fixed a bug in FIS_vOSDMap, which returned an false address
            'Official release'

2008-02-25  Fixed a bug in File Selector, which didn't display German Umlaute
2008-03-05  Added the parameter PID to HDD_FindPCR
2008-03-07  Recoded HDD_LiveFS_GetPreviousCluster and HDD_LiveFS_GetLastCluster in assembler: now it runs about 4000 times faster
2008-03-17  Modified some FIS patterns to make them work on a broader range of firmwares
2008-03-18  isMasterpiece uses FIS_fwUpdateMPVFD instead of a hard coded SysID table
2008-03-19  Modified FlashProgram to use TAP_WriteSystemVar instead of creating and deleting a timer
            Added DISPLAY_TYPE to the Firmware.dat database. Keep in mind that TF5000s and TF5200s will report
              DT_LED even if they may have been upgraded to DT_VFD5500. Use TAP_Vfd_GetStatus to detect this
              kind of display.
            MPDisplayDisplayLongString translates Ä, Ö, Ü into AE, OE and UE only if the OSD language is set to German, otherwise the
              MP VFD will show A, O and U respectively.
2008-03-27  'Official release'

2008-04-05  Fixed a bug in FIS_vPlaySlot
2008-04-18  Fixed a bug in FIS_vFlashFWStartOffset (thanks to R2-D2)
            R2-D2 has translated the original lh5 Pascal sources to "fix" a compression bug which seems to be tripped
              by the new TF5810 firmware. lh5 replaces AREncode and ARDecode, but there's no change in the interface.
2008-04-23  TAP_Hdd_StopTs added to TAPAPIFix by R2-D2
            'Official release'

2008-05-01  TAP_HDD_Delete also seem to be unable to delete files with a very long name. So the APIFixed version now renames every
              file before deleting it
2008-05-08  The TYPE_TpInfoT has been updated (thanks to R2-D2). NetworkID has been renamed to OriginalNetworkID!
2008-05-16  Renamed the FIS_vRecFile parameter from "Slot" to "DemuxPath". This is not a code change, but the parameter has a different
            meaning. To convert from Slot to DemuxPath do a

            tRECSlot *RECSlot = (tRECSlot*) FIS_vRECSlotAddress(Slot);
            if (RECSlot) RECFile = (tFileSlot*) FIS_vRecFile(RECSlot ->DemuxPath);

2008-06-28  Increased the speed of HDD_LiveFS_GetNextCluster()

            Added the new function SetRemoteMode
            Modified the tFileSlot struct for a better alignment
            Bugfix: RecHdr in the tPlaySlot struct shouldn't be a pointer
2008-08-09  HDD_FreeSize returned the used instead of the free space
2008-08-09  'Official release'

2008-10-05  The new TF6000ES firmware (SysID 2457, 2008-09-28) has a stripped down event routine. Instead of taking "EventID" and "Param"
              it is now designed to work for key events only (0xe300). Added a SysID check to "Shutdown.c" so that the shutdown event
              will be directly injected into the EventDispatcher on these machines.
2008-10-08  'Official release'

2009-07-04  FlashFindEndOfServiceTableAddress() also uses the PMTPID to detect invalid entries
            FlashProgram() deliberately modifies the CRC of the TVServices in the memory to ensure that the flash will be update

            Bugfix @ HDD_TAP_Start() [TMS]: the launched TAP is now in the same directory as the launcher, not /ProgramFiles

                          HDD_GetInodeByTypeFile, FixInvalidFileName, HDD_Unrecycle, HDD_Delete, HDD_Recycle, HDD_Rename,
                          MakeUniqueFileNamea and SeparateFileNameComponents
            Renamed StrEndsWith to StringEndsWith due to a clash with the TMS development environment

2009-09-05  Changed Shutdown to work with the newest Aussie f/w

2009-09-07  HDD_GetFileTimeByAbsFileName and HDD_GetInodeByAbsFileName need to use lstat64() to work with files >= 4GB

            Fixed the FlashBlockOffsetSTMS table to make it downward compatible with the 5k versions
            HDD_Delete() and HDD_Recycle() try to stop a playback before it tries to delete the file

            Added the function HDD_isFileInUse() and the enum tFileInUse
            Added the TYPE_AutoDescrambleTimer struct
            Added the struct tVFDIcon and the functions VFD_SetIcon(), VFD_EnableCDAnimation() and VFD_CDAnimation()

2009-12-20  Ported isAnyOSDVisible()
2009-12-25  HDD_Recycle() and HDD_Delete() adapted to a firmware bug (TAP_Hdd_StopTs() doesn't stop anything, TAP_Hdd_StopMp3() stops both .recs and .mp3s)
            Some changes to make the lib compatible with the Australian TRF-2400 (.rec and .mpg): HDD_isFileInUse(), SeparateFileNameComponents()
2009-12-28  Despite the FromDir parameter, HDD_Move() expected to be in the FromDir folder, else the FileExist check failed
            Added: DayOfWeek()

            Added isAnyOSDVisibleEx(), which allows to check a specific plane
2010-11-01  Bugfix: FixInvalidFileName() must not rename files, which are currently being recorded or played
            Added isAnyOSDVisibleEx(), which allows to specify the OSD plane
